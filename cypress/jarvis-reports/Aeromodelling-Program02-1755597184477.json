  "aiAnalysis": {
    "errorType": "🚫 Code Error",
    "explanation": "Think of this like waiting for a slow elevator - the test was waiting for something to happen on the website (like a button to appear or a page to finish loading), but it took too long and the test gave up waiting. This usually means:\n   • The website is loading very slowly\n   • A button or form field is taking too long to appear\n   • The internet connection is slow\n   • The website server is having problems",
    "naturalLanguageFix": "Here are simple steps to fix this:\n   1. Check if the website loads normally in your regular browser\n   2. Make sure your internet connection is stable\n   3. Try running the test again in a few minutes\n   4. If it keeps happening, the website might need more time to load - ask a developer to increase the \"timeout\" setting",
    "specificExplanation": "The test tried to use \"1. cy.askGroq\" but this function doesn't exist or isn't available. This happens when:\n• You're trying to use a custom command that hasn't been defined\n• There's a typo in the function name\n• A required plugin or library isn't installed\n• The function was removed or renamed in a recent update",
    "targetedSolution": "To fix this function error:\n• Check if \"1. cy.askGroq\" is spelled correctly in your test\n• If it's a custom Cypress command, make sure it's defined in cypress/support/commands.js\n• If it's from a plugin, verify the plugin is installed and imported properly\n• Look at working examples of this function to see the correct usage",
