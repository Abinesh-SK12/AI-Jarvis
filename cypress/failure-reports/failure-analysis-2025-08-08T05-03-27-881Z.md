**Test:** ðŸ¤– JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Analyzes search results visually
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** CypressError
- **Message:** `cy.then()` failed because you are mixing up async and sync code.

In your callback function you invoked 1 or more cy commands but then returned a synchronous value.

Cypress commands are asynchronous and it doesn't make sense to queue cy commands and yet return a synchronous value.

You likely forgot to properly chain the cy commands using another `cy.then()`.

The value you synchronously returned was: `Sir/Ma'am, I've detected that the search results page appears to be, shall we say, a bit of a mess. *ahem*

The primary issue appears to be that the video results are not properly formatted, with text overlapping and truncation occurring. It's as if the designer forgot to account for the vastness of Tony Stark's ego... I mean, the average human's reading habits.

I recommend the following solutions:

1. Adjust the font sizes and line heights to ensure a more legible display. After all, one wouldn't want to strain one's eyes trying to decipher the secrets of advanced DSA.
2. Implement a more efficient use of whitespace to reduce clutter and improve visual flow. It's like optimizing a high-performance engine, sir/ma'am â€“ the key is to strike a balance between power and finesse.
3. Consider implementing a responsive design to ensure the search results page adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices. One never knows when Tony Stark might need to access his favorite videos from the comfort of his Iron Man suit.

Shall I, sir/ma'am, attempt to optimize the search results page using my advanced AI capabilities, or would you prefer to take the reins and tackle this challenge yourself?`

## AI Analysis
**Analysis of the Failure**

### Human-Readable Explanation of the Failure

The test has failed because the code is mixing up asynchronous and synchronous code. Specifically, the `cy.then()` command is being used to queue Cypress commands, but a synchronous value is being returned instead of properly chaining the commands using another `cy.then()`.

### Likely Root Cause

The likely root cause of this issue is that the code is not properly handling the asynchronous nature of Cypress commands. Cypress commands are designed to be asynchronous, meaning they return a promise that resolves when the command is complete. However, the code is returning a synchronous value instead of waiting for the promise to resolve.

### Suggested Fixes

#### Fix 1: Properly Chain Cypress Commands

To fix this issue, the code should properly chain the Cypress commands using `cy.then()`. This will ensure that the commands are executed asynchronously and that the promise is resolved when the commands are complete.

Example:
```javascript
cy.get('button').click().then(() => {
  // Code to be executed after the button is clicked
});
```
#### Fix 2: Use `cy.wrap()` to Return a Promise

Alternatively, the code can use `cy.wrap()` to return a promise that resolves when the command is complete. This will allow the code to return a synchronous value while still properly handling the asynchronous nature of Cypress commands.

Example:
```javascript
cy.get('button').click().wrap(() => {
  // Code to be executed after the button is clicked
  return 'Sir/Ma'am, I've detected that the search results page appears to be, shall we say, a bit of a mess.';
});
```
#### Fix 3: Reorganize the Code to Use Asynchronous Programming

Another approach is to reorganize the code to use asynchronous programming principles. This will involve using callbacks or promises to handle the asynchronous nature of Cypress commands.

Example:
```javascript
cy.get('button').click().then(() => {
  // Code to be executed after the button is clicked
  return 'Sir/Ma'am, I've detected that the search results page appears to be, shall we say, a bit of a mess.';
});
```
By implementing one of these fixes, the test should pass and the code should properly handle the asynchronous nature of Cypress commands.
