**Test:** ðŸ¤– JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Visual analysis of YouTube homepage
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** CypressError
- **Message:** `cy.then()` failed because you are mixing up async and sync code.

In your callback function you invoked 1 or more cy commands but then returned a synchronous value.

Cypress commands are asynchronous and it doesn't make sense to queue cy commands and yet return a synchronous value.

You likely forgot to properly chain the cy commands using another `cy.then()`.

The value you synchronously returned was: `Sir/Ma'am, I've detected a visually...interesting scene on the YouTube homepage.

The primary issue appears to be a rather...creative interpretation of the YouTube interface. It seems the OCR software has had a bit of a rough time deciphering the text, resulting in a rather...unique set of words and characters.

I recommend taking a step back and re-running the analysis, perhaps with a different OCR algorithm or a more...precise approach. Additionally, a quick tidy-up of the screenshot might help clarify the text and make it easier to read.

Shall I attempt to extract the relevant information from the screenshot, and perhaps even provide a cleaned-up version of the text for your perusal, sir/ma'am?`

## AI Analysis
# Analysis of the Failure

## Human-Readable Explanation of the Failure

The test has failed because the code is mixing up asynchronous and synchronous code. The `cy.then()` command is used to chain Cypress commands, but in this case, it is being used incorrectly. The code is returning a synchronous value after invoking Cypress commands, which is not allowed.

## Likely Root Cause

The likely root cause of this issue is that the code is not properly chaining the Cypress commands using `cy.then()`. Instead, it is returning a synchronous value after invoking the commands. This is causing the test to fail because Cypress commands are asynchronous and cannot be mixed with synchronous code.

## Suggested Fixes

### Fix 1: Properly Chain Cypress Commands

Make sure to properly chain the Cypress commands using `cy.then()`. For example:
```javascript
cy.get('selector').then(() => {
  // code to execute after the command
})
```
### Fix 2: Use `cy.wrap()` to Return a Promise

Instead of returning a synchronous value, use `cy.wrap()` to return a promise. For example:
```javascript
cy.get('selector').then(() => {
  return cy.wrap('Sir/Ma'am, I've detected a visually...interesting scene on the YouTube homepage.');
})
```
### Fix 3: Use `cy.log()` to Log the Value

If the code is intended to log the value, use `cy.log()` instead of returning a synchronous value. For example:
```javascript
cy.get('selector').then(() => {
  cy.log('Sir/Ma'am, I've detected a visually...interesting scene on the YouTube homepage.');
})
```
By implementing one of these fixes, the test should pass and the issue should be resolved.
