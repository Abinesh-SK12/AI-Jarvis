**Test:** ðŸ¤– JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Visual analysis of YouTube homepage
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** CypressError
- **Message:** `cy.then()` failed because you are mixing up async and sync code.

In your callback function you invoked 1 or more cy commands but then returned a synchronous value.

Cypress commands are asynchronous and it doesn't make sense to queue cy commands and yet return a synchronous value.

You likely forgot to properly chain the cy commands using another `cy.then()`.

The value you synchronously returned was: `Sir/Ma'am, I've detected a most...interesting visual debugging data on the YouTube homepage.

The primary issue appears to be a garbled mess of text and images, likely the result of a technical malfunction. It appears the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) algorithm has gone awry, rendering the text illegible.

I recommend the following solutions:

1. Run a diagnostic scan on the OCR software to identify and rectify any glitches.
2. Check for any conflicts with additional browser extensions or plugins that may be interfering with the page's rendering.
3. Attempt to reload the page in a private browsing mode to isolate any issues specific to the current session.

Shall I, sir/madam, attempt to troubleshoot the issue further or would you like me to provide further assistance?`

## AI Analysis
**Analysis of the Failure**

### Human-Readable Explanation

The test has failed because the code is mixing up asynchronous and synchronous code. The `cy.then()` command is used to chain asynchronous commands, but in this case, a synchronous value is being returned. This is causing the test to fail.

### Likely Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is likely that the code is not properly chaining the Cypress commands using `cy.then()`. This is causing the asynchronous commands to be executed out of order, resulting in the test failure.

### Suggested Fixes

#### Fix 1: Properly Chain Cypress Commands

Make sure to properly chain the Cypress commands using `cy.then()`. This will ensure that the commands are executed in the correct order and that the test runs successfully.

Example:
```javascript
cy.get('button').click()
  .then(() => {
    // code to execute after button click
  });
```
#### Fix 2: Use `cy.wrap()` to Return a Promise

If you need to return a value from a Cypress command, use `cy.wrap()` to wrap the value in a promise. This will allow the command to be executed asynchronously and will prevent the test from failing.

Example:
```javascript
cy.get('button').click()
  .then(() => {
    return cy.wrap('Button clicked');
  });
```
#### Fix 3: Use `cy.then()` to Handle the Response

If you need to handle the response from a Cypress command, use `cy.then()` to handle the response. This will ensure that the response is handled asynchronously and will prevent the test from failing.

Example:
```javascript
cy.get('button').click()
  .then(() => {
    cy.then((response) => {
      // code to handle the response
    });
  });
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
