**Test:** ðŸ¤– JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Multi-step visual workflow analysis
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** CypressError
- **Message:** `cy.then()` failed because you are mixing up async and sync code.

In your callback function you invoked 1 or more cy commands but then returned a synchronous value.

Cypress commands are asynchronous and it doesn't make sense to queue cy commands and yet return a synchronous value.

You likely forgot to properly chain the cy commands using another `cy.then()`.

The value you synchronously returned was: `Sir/Ma'am, I've detected a rather...fascinating visual debugging data in front of me. It appears to be a screenshot of the YouTube homepage, replete with an assortment of videos, channels, and advertisements. Now, let's dive into the nitty-gritty, shall we?

The primary issue appears to be a rather...creative...use of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology. It's attempting to extract text from the screenshot, but the results are a bit...ungrammatical, to say the least. I'd venture to guess that the algorithm is struggling with the complexities of the Indian film industry, not to mention the peculiarities of Tony Stark's sarcasm.

I recommend the following solutions:

1. A gentle dusting of the OCR algorithm with a bit of machine learning magic should help refine the text extraction process. Perhaps a dash of natural language processing would help the AI better comprehend the nuances of human language?
2. A spot of manual editing might be in order to tidy up the extracted text and remove any...unwanted...characters. A bit of human oversight can go a long way in ensuring the accuracy of the data.
3. For good measure, I suggest a quick scan of the screenshot using a dedicated image processing algorithm to eliminate any noise or artifacts that might be skewing the OCR results.

Shall I, sir/ma'am, proceed with implementing these solutions? Or would you like me to...reboot the system...and start from scratch?`

## AI Analysis
**Analysis**

### What Went Wrong

The test failed due to a mix of asynchronous and synchronous code in the callback function. Cypress commands are asynchronous, and it's not possible to queue them and return a synchronous value.

### Likely Root Cause

The root cause is likely that the test is trying to return a synchronous value from a callback function that contains Cypress commands. This is causing the `cy.then()` command to fail because it's expecting an asynchronous value.

### Suggested Fixes

#### 1. Properly Chain Cypress Commands

To fix this issue, you need to properly chain the Cypress commands using `cy.then()` or other asynchronous control flows. This will ensure that the commands are executed asynchronously and return the expected values.

#### 2. Use Async/Await Syntax

Alternatively, you can use async/await syntax to write your code in a more synchronous-looking way. This can make your code easier to read and maintain.

#### 3. Return a Promise

If you need to return a value from a callback function that contains Cypress commands, you can return a promise instead. This will allow the test to wait for the promise to resolve before continuing.

By implementing one of these solutions, you should be able to fix the issue and get your test running again.
