## Error Details
- **Type:** TypeError
- **Message:** cy.get(...).should(...).then(...).catch is not a function

## AI Analysis
# Analysis of Failed Test

## Human-Readable Explanation

The test has failed due to a `TypeError` when trying to use the `then` and `catch` methods with the `cy.get` command. This suggests that the `cy.get` command is not returning a promise that can be chained with the `then` and `catch` methods.

## Likely Root Cause

The likely root cause is that the `cy.get` command is not returning a promise that can be chained with the `then` and `catch` methods. This could be due to a few reasons:

* The `cy.get` command is not finding any elements on the page, and therefore is not returning a promise.
* The `cy.get` command is finding elements, but they are not visible or interactable, and therefore the `then` and `catch` methods are not being called.
* There is an issue with the Cypress configuration or setup that is preventing the `cy.get` command from returning a promise.

## Suggested Fixes

### Fix 1: Verify Element Existence

Try to verify if the elements are present on the page by using the `cy.get` command without the `should` and `then` methods. If the elements are present, the `cy.get` command should return a promise that can be chained with the `then` and `catch` methods.

```cypress
cy.get('selector').then(() => {
  // code to execute when elements are found
}).catch(() => {
  // code to execute when elements are not found
});
```

### Fix 2: Check Element Visibility

If the elements are present but not visible, try to use the `cy.get` command with the `should` method to verify the element's visibility.

```cypress
cy.get('selector').should('be.visible').then(() => {
  // code to execute when elements are visible
}).catch(() => {
  // code to execute when elements are not visible
});
```

### Fix 3: Check Cypress Configuration

Verify that the Cypress configuration is set up correctly and that the `cy.get` command is being used correctly. Check the Cypress documentation for any specific requirements or limitations for the `cy.get` command.

If none of these fixes work, it may be necessary to provide more information about the test and the environment in which it is running.
