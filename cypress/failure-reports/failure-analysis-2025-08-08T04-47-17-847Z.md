# Failure Analysis

## Human-Readable Explanation

The test "DEMO: Manual failure analysis" has failed because the expected page was not loaded. The test was expecting to be on the Netflix page, but instead, it landed on the YouTube page. This suggests that the test navigation or routing logic is incorrect.

## Likely Root Cause

The likely root cause of this failure is an issue with the test's navigation or routing logic. This could be due to a mistake in the test's code, such as an incorrect URL or a faulty navigation command. Alternatively, it could be due to a problem with the application's routing or navigation, such as a misconfigured route or a bug in the application's code.

## Suggested Fixes

### 1. Review Test Code

Review the test code to ensure that the navigation or routing logic is correct. Check for any typos or mistakes in the URL or navigation commands. Verify that the test is using the correct browser or device to ensure that the issue is not specific to a particular browser or device.

### 2. Verify Application Routing

Verify that the application's routing or navigation is correct. Check the application's code to ensure that the routes are properly configured and that the navigation logic is working as expected. If the issue is specific to a particular route or navigation path, try to isolate the problem and fix the issue.

### 3. Use Debugging Tools

Use Cypress's built-in debugging tools to debug the test. Use the `cy.log()` command to log information about the test's execution and the `cy.get()` command to retrieve elements on the page. This can help to identify the exact point where the test is failing and provide more information about the issue.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the test failure.
