## AI Analysis
# Analysis of Failed Cypress Test

## Human-Readable Explanation of What Went Wrong

The test failed due to a `TypeError` when trying to use the `then` and `catch` methods with the `cy.get` command. This suggests that the `cy.get` command is not returning a promise that can be chained with `then` and `catch` methods.

## Likely Root Cause

The likely root cause is that the `cy.get` command is not returning a promise that can be chained with `then` and `catch` methods. This could be due to a few reasons:

* The element being searched for is not found on the page, and the `cy.get` command is returning `undefined` instead of a promise.
* The `cy.get` command is returning a promise that is not being resolved or rejected, causing the `then` and `catch` methods to fail.

## Suggested Fixes

### Fix 1: Verify Element Existence

Before using the `then` and `catch` methods, verify that the element is found on the page using the `should` method. This can be done by modifying the test as follows:
```cypress
cy.get('selector').should('be.visible');
cy.get('selector').then(() => {
  // Code to execute when the element is found
}).catch(() => {
  // Code to execute when the element is not found
});
```
### Fix 2: Check Element Return Value

Check the return value of the `cy.get` command to ensure it is a promise that can be chained with `then` and `catch` methods. You can do this by logging the return value of the `cy.get` command:
```cypress
const element = cy.get('selector');
console.log(element);
element.then(() => {
  // Code to execute when the element is found
}).catch(() => {
  // Code to execute when the element is not found
});
```
### Fix 3: Use `cy.wrap` to Return a Promise

If the `cy.get` command is not returning a promise, you can use the `cy.wrap` command to wrap the result in a promise that can be chained with `then` and `catch` methods:
```cypress
cy.get('selector').then((element) => {
  // Code to execute when the element is found
}).catch(() => {
  // Code to execute when the element is not found
});
```
By implementing one of these fixes, you should be able to resolve the `TypeError` and get your test running successfully again.
