## Error Details
- **Type:** TypeError
- **Message:** cy.get(...).should(...).then(...).catch is not a function

## AI Analysis
**Analysis of Failed Test**

### Human-Readable Explanation of What Went Wrong

The test failed with a `TypeError` because the `cy.get()`, `should()`, `then()`, and `catch()` methods are not being used correctly. It appears that the test is trying to chain these methods together, but one or more of them is not a function.

### Likely Root Cause

The root cause is likely that the `catch()` method is not being used correctly. The `then()` method returns a promise, and the `catch()` method is used to handle any errors that may occur when resolving that promise. However, it seems that the `catch()` method is not being recognized as a function, which is causing the `TypeError`.

### Suggested Fixes

#### Fix 1: Check the Syntax of the `catch()` Method

Make sure that the `catch()` method is being used correctly. It should be called on the promise returned by the `then()` method, like this:
```javascript
cy.get(...).should(...).then(() => {
  // code to execute on success
}).catch((error) => {
  // code to execute on error
});
```
#### Fix 2: Verify the Order of Method Calls

Ensure that the methods are being called in the correct order. The `should()` method should be called after the `get()` method, and the `then()` method should be called after the `should()` method. The `catch()` method should be called after the `then()` method.

#### Fix 3: Check for Typos or Incorrect Method Names

Double-check that there are no typos or incorrect method names in the code. Make sure that the methods are being called correctly and that there are no syntax errors.

By implementing one or more of these fixes, the test should be able to run successfully and provide accurate results.
