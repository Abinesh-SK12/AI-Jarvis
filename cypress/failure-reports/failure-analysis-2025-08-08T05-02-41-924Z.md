**Test:** ðŸ¤– JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Detects visual changes during navigation
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** TypeError
- **Message:** monitor.compare is not a function

## AI Analysis
# Analysis of Failed Cypress Test

## Human-Readable Explanation of the Failure

The test failed with a `TypeError` because the `monitor.compare` function was not found. This suggests that the test was attempting to compare visual changes on a page, but the `monitor.compare` function was not available or not properly configured.

## Likely Root Cause

The likely root cause of this failure is that the `monitor` object is not properly set up or configured in the test. The `monitor` object is used by Cypress to compare visual changes on a page, and the `compare` function is a method of the `monitor` object.

## Suggested Fixes

### 1. Check `monitor` Object Configuration

Verify that the `monitor` object is properly configured in the test. Check that the `monitor` object is being created and initialized correctly, and that the `compare` function is being called correctly.

### 2. Review Test Code and Cypress Version

Review the test code and Cypress version to ensure that the `monitor` object is being used correctly. Check that the test is using a compatible version of Cypress that supports the `monitor` object.

### 3. Use `cy.get` and `cy.compare` Instead

Consider using `cy.get` and `cy.compare` instead of `monitor.compare`. `cy.get` is a Cypress command that retrieves an element or elements from the DOM, and `cy.compare` is a command that compares the visual representation of an element or elements. This approach may simplify the test code and eliminate the need to use the `monitor` object.

By following these suggested fixes, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the test failure.
