**Test:** ðŸ¤– JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Analyzes error pages visually
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** CypressError
- **Message:** `cy.then()` failed because you are mixing up async and sync code.

In your callback function you invoked 1 or more cy commands but then returned a synchronous value.

Cypress commands are asynchronous and it doesn't make sense to queue cy commands and yet return a synchronous value.

You likely forgot to properly chain the cy commands using another `cy.then()`.

The value you synchronously returned was: `Sir/Ma'am, I've detected a rather...unfortunate situation. It seems we've stumbled upon an error page on YouTube.

The primary issue appears to be a 404 error, indicating that the requested page cannot be found. The message suggests that the URL may be invalid or has been removed.

I recommend the following solutions:

1. Check the URL for any typos or incorrect characters. It's possible that a small mistake has caused the error.
2. Try accessing the page through a different browser or device to rule out any browser-specific issues.
3. If the issue persists, it may be worth checking the YouTube status page to see if there are any known outages or maintenance scheduled for the platform.

Shall I attempt to access the page again and see if I can detect any further issues, sir/ma'am? Perhaps I can uncover the root cause of this...error?`

## AI Analysis
## Analysis of the Failure

### Human-Readable Explanation of What Went Wrong

The test has failed because the code is mixing up asynchronous and synchronous code. Specifically, the `cy.then()` command is being used to queue Cypress commands, but the function is also returning a synchronous value. This is causing the test to fail.

### Likely Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is likely that the code is not properly chaining the Cypress commands using `cy.then()`. This is causing the asynchronous code to be executed synchronously, which is not allowed in Cypress.

### Suggested Fixes

#### Fix 1: Properly Chain Cypress Commands

Make sure to properly chain the Cypress commands using `cy.then()` or other asynchronous methods. This will ensure that the code is executed asynchronously and correctly.

Example:
```javascript
cy.visit('https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium')
  .then(() => {
    // Code to be executed after the page has loaded
  });
```
#### Fix 2: Use Async/Await Syntax

Consider using async/await syntax to write the code in a more readable and maintainable way. This can help to avoid mixing up asynchronous and synchronous code.

Example:
```javascript
async function myFunction() {
  await cy.visit('https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium');
  // Code to be executed after the page has loaded
}
```
#### Fix 3: Review Code for Synchronous Values

Review the code to ensure that it is not returning synchronous values. Cypress commands are asynchronous, so it's important to ensure that the code is written to accommodate this.

Example:
```javascript
cy.visit('https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium')
  .then(() => {
    // Code to be executed after the page has loaded
  })
  .should(() => {
    // Assert that the page has loaded correctly
  });
```
By implementing these fixes, the test should be able to pass and the issue should be resolved.
