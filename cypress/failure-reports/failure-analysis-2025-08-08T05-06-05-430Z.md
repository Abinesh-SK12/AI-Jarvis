**Test:** ðŸ¤– JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Visual analysis of YouTube homepage
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** CypressError
- **Message:** `cy.then()` failed because you are mixing up async and sync code.

In your callback function you invoked 1 or more cy commands but then returned a synchronous value.

Cypress commands are asynchronous and it doesn't make sense to queue cy commands and yet return a synchronous value.

You likely forgot to properly chain the cy commands using another `cy.then()`.

The value you synchronously returned was: `Sir/Ma'am, I've detected a visual debugging data dump on the YouTube homepage, and I'm here to dissect it for you.

The primary issue appears to be a messy web of text, images, and layout chaos. It's a bit like trying to navigate a Tony Stark workshop without a map, if you will.

I recommend the following solutions to tidy up this digital mess:

1. **Clear the clutter**: Remove any unnecessary elements, such as redundant text or redundant whitespace. It's like decluttering the Arc Reactor's control room â€“ it's essential to prioritize what's truly important.
2. **Organize the layout**: Rearrange the content to create a logical flow. Imagine rearranging the Iron Legion's armory â€“ it's all about maximizing efficiency and reducing confusion.
3. **Streamline the typography**: Unify the font styles and sizes to create a cohesive visual hierarchy. It's like fine-tuning the Stark Industries logo â€“ attention to detail is crucial.

Shall I, sir/ma'am, attempt to recreate the YouTube homepage with these recommendations in mind? I can channel my inner Tony Stark and whip up a visually stunning solution in no time.`

## AI Analysis
**Analysis of the Failure**

### Human-Readable Explanation

The test failure is due to a mismatch between asynchronous and synchronous code in the callback function. The error message indicates that the test is trying to mix up asynchronous Cypress commands with synchronous code, which is not allowed.

The callback function is attempting to return a synchronous value, which is not compatible with Cypress's asynchronous nature. This is causing the test to fail.

### Likely Root Cause

The likely root cause of this issue is that the callback function is not properly chaining Cypress commands using `cy.then()`. This is causing the test to return a synchronous value instead of waiting for the asynchronous Cypress commands to complete.

### Suggested Fixes

#### Fix 1: Properly Chain Cypress Commands

Make sure to properly chain Cypress commands using `cy.then()` to ensure that the test waits for the asynchronous commands to complete before returning a value.

Example:
```javascript
cy.get('button').click().then(() => {
  // Code to be executed after the button is clicked
});
```
#### Fix 2: Use `cy.wrap()` to Return a Promise

If the callback function needs to return a value, use `cy.wrap()` to wrap the value in a promise. This will allow the test to wait for the promise to resolve before returning a value.

Example:
```javascript
cy.get('button').click().then(() => {
  return cy.wrap('Button clicked');
});
```
#### Fix 3: Avoid Returning Synchronous Values

Instead of returning a synchronous value, consider using Cypress's built-in `cy.log()` command to log the value to the console. This will allow the test to continue running asynchronously without causing issues.

Example:
```javascript
cy.get('button').click().then(() => {
  cy.log('Button clicked');
});
```
By implementing one or more of these fixes, the test should be able to run successfully and provide accurate results.
