**Test:** ü§ñ JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Smart visual element detection
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** CypressError
- **Message:** `cy.then()` failed because you are mixing up async and sync code.

In your callback function you invoked 1 or more cy commands but then returned a synchronous value.

Cypress commands are asynchronous and it doesn't make sense to queue cy commands and yet return a synchronous value.

You likely forgot to properly chain the cy commands using another `cy.then()`.

The value you synchronously returned was: `Sir/Ma'am, I've detected a rather... eclectic visual landscape on your screen. It appears to be a m√©lange of YouTube-related UI elements, with a dash of debugging data thrown in for good measure.

The primary issue appears to be a rather messy layout, with various text elements and buttons strewn about like a digital game of Tetris gone wrong. It seems that the usual YouTube interface has been, shall we say, " augmented" with a plethora of debugging data and cryptic messages.

I recommend the following solutions to tidy up this digital mess:

1. Clear the debugging data: I suggest deleting or hiding the debugging information to restore the YouTube interface to its usual sleek and streamlined self.
2. Reorganize the layout: A bit of UI juggling might be in order to create a more visually pleasing and functional layout. Perhaps a tidy row of buttons and a clean, uncluttered text area?
3. Disable any unnecessary extensions: It's possible that one or more browser extensions are contributing to this visual chaos. I recommend disabling any unused or redundant extensions to simplify the interface.

Shall I, sir/madam, take the liberty of tidying up this digital mess for you?`

## AI Analysis
**Analysis of the Cypress Test Failure**

### Human-Readable Explanation of the Failure

The test failure is due to a mix of asynchronous and synchronous code in the callback function of a `cy.then()` command. This is causing Cypress to fail because it expects the callback function to return a promise or a value that can be awaited, but instead, it's returning a synchronous value.

### Likely Root Cause

The likely root cause of this issue is that the callback function is not properly chaining the Cypress commands using another `cy.then()` command. This is causing the test to return a synchronous value instead of a promise, which is not compatible with Cypress's asynchronous nature.

### Suggested Fixes

#### Fix 1: Properly Chain Cypress Commands

Make sure to properly chain the Cypress commands using another `cy.then()` command. This will ensure that the test returns a promise that can be awaited, rather than a synchronous value.

Example:
```javascript
cy.then(() => {
  // Code that invokes Cypress commands
  cy.get('button').click();
  return 'Hello World';
}).then((result) => {
  // Code that handles the result
  console.log(result);
});
```
#### Fix 2: Use `cy.wrap()` to Return a Promise

If the callback function needs to return a synchronous value, use `cy.wrap()` to wrap the value in a promise. This will allow the test to return a promise that can be awaited.

Example:
```javascript
cy.then(() => {
  // Code that invokes Cypress commands
  cy.get('button').click();
  return cy.wrap('Hello World');
}).then((result) => {
  // Code that handles the result
  console.log(result);
});
```
#### Fix 3: Refactor the Code to Use Asynchronous Code

Refactor the code to use asynchronous code instead of synchronous code. This will ensure that the test returns a promise that can be awaited, rather than a synchronous value.

Example:
```javascript
cy.then(() => {
  // Code that invokes Cypress commands
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    cy.get('button').click();
    resolve('Hello World');
  });
}).then((result) => {
  // Code that handles the result
  console.log(result);
});
```
By implementing one of these fixes, the test should pass and the issue should be resolved.
