**Test:** ðŸ¤– JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Analyzes error pages visually
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** CypressError
- **Message:** `cy.then()` failed because you are mixing up async and sync code.

In your callback function you invoked 1 or more cy commands but then returned a synchronous value.

Cypress commands are asynchronous and it doesn't make sense to queue cy commands and yet return a synchronous value.

You likely forgot to properly chain the cy commands using another `cy.then()`.

The value you synchronously returned was: `Sir/Ma'am, I've detected a rather...unfortunate situation. The visual debugging data indicates that the page currently displayed is, in fact, an error page.

The primary issue appears to be a 404 not found error, suggesting that the requested URL does not exist or is temporarily unavailable.

I recommend the following solutions to rectify the situation:

1. Verify the URL: Double-check the URL to ensure it is correct and properly formatted. A single misplaced character can make all the difference, Sir/Ma'am.
2. Search for alternatives: The error page suggests searching for something else. If the desired content is not available at the current URL, perhaps searching for related keywords or topics might yield more promising results.
3. Check browser settings: Occasionally, browser settings or extensions can interfere with page loading. I suggest checking the browser's settings and extensions to ensure they are not causing any conflicts.

Shall I, Sir/Ma'am, attempt to troubleshoot the issue further or perhaps suggest alternative methods to find the desired content?`

## AI Analysis
**Analysis of the Failure**

### What Went Wrong
The test failed because of a mix of asynchronous and synchronous code in the callback function of a `cy.then()` command. This is causing Cypress to throw an error, as it doesn't make sense to queue Cypress commands and then return a synchronous value.

### Likely Root Cause
The root cause of the issue is likely that the callback function is returning a synchronous value instead of properly chaining the Cypress commands using another `cy.then()`.

### Suggested Fixes

#### 1. Verify the URL
Double-check the URL to ensure it is correct and properly formatted. A single misplaced character can make all the difference. This can be done by adding a `cy.url()` command to verify the URL before attempting to analyze the error page.

#### 2. Search for Alternatives
Instead of returning a synchronous value, consider using `cy.then()` to chain the commands and search for alternatives. For example, you could use `cy.get()` to search for related keywords or topics.

#### 3. Check Browser Settings
Occasionally, browser settings or extensions can interfere with page loading. Consider adding a `cy.get()` command to check the browser's settings and extensions to ensure they are not causing any conflicts.

By implementing these fixes, you should be able to resolve the issue and get the test to pass.
