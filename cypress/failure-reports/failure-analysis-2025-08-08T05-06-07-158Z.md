## AI Analysis
# Analysis of Failed Cypress Test

## Human-Readable Explanation of the Failure

The test failure occurred when attempting to run the "JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Detects visual changes during navigation" test. The test was expecting to detect visual changes during navigation, but instead, it encountered a `TypeError` with the message "monitor.compare is not a function". This suggests that the `monitor.compare` function is not available or is not being used correctly in the test.

## Likely Root Cause

The likely root cause of this failure is that the `monitor.compare` function is not defined or is not being imported correctly in the test. This function is likely used to compare the expected and actual visual changes during navigation, but without it, the test cannot perform the comparison.

## Suggested Fixes

### 1. Check Function Definition and Import

Review the test code to ensure that the `monitor.compare` function is defined and imported correctly. Check if the function is defined in the same file or in a separate file that is being imported. Verify that the function is being used correctly in the test.

### 2. Check for Typos or Misspellings

Double-check the test code for any typos or misspellings that may be causing the function to be undefined. Make sure that the function name is spelled correctly and that there are no extra characters or spaces that may be causing the issue.

### 3. Check Cypress Version and Configuration

Verify that the Cypress version being used is compatible with the test code. Check the Cypress configuration file (usually `cypress/support/index.js`) to ensure that the correct version of Cypress is being used. Also, check if there are any configuration settings that may be affecting the test.

By reviewing the test code, checking for typos, and verifying Cypress configuration, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the test failure.
