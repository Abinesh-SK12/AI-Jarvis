**Test:** ðŸ¤– JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Analyzes error pages visually
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** CypressError
- **Message:** `cy.then()` failed because you are mixing up async and sync code.

In your callback function you invoked 1 or more cy commands but then returned a synchronous value.

Cypress commands are asynchronous and it doesn't make sense to queue cy commands and yet return a synchronous value.

You likely forgot to properly chain the cy commands using another `cy.then()`.

The value you synchronously returned was: `Sir/Ma'am, I've detected an error page, and I'm not thrilled about it. The primary issue appears to be a 404 Not Found error, likely caused by an incorrect URL or a temporary issue with the YouTube servers.

I recommend the following course of action:

1. Check the URL: Verify that the URL is correct and try re-entering it. It's possible that there's a minor typo or a character out of place.
2. Search for something else: As the error message suggests, try searching for a different topic or video on YouTube. It might be a temporary issue with the specific page you're trying to access.
3. Clear browser cache: Sometimes, a simple cache clear can resolve the issue. I can assist you with that, if you'd like.

Shall I, Sir/Ma'am, attempt to debug the issue further or would you like me to try clearing the browser cache and re-attempting the access?`

## AI Analysis
**Analysis**

### Human-Readable Explanation

The test has failed because the code is mixing up asynchronous and synchronous code. Specifically, the `cy.then()` command is being used to chain Cypress commands, but a synchronous value is being returned instead of properly chaining the commands.

### Likely Root Cause

The root cause is likely that the code is not properly chaining the Cypress commands using `cy.then()`, which is causing the test to fail. This is because Cypress commands are asynchronous, and returning a synchronous value can cause unexpected behavior.

### Suggested Fixes

#### Fix 1: Properly Chain Cypress Commands

Make sure to properly chain the Cypress commands using `cy.then()` or other chaining methods. This will ensure that the commands are executed asynchronously and correctly.

Example:
```javascript
cy.visit('https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium')
  .then(() => {
    // Code to analyze error page visually
  });
```
#### Fix 2: Use `cy.wrap()` to Return a Promise

If the code needs to return a value, use `cy.wrap()` to wrap the value in a promise. This will allow the code to return a promise that can be handled by Cypress.

Example:
```javascript
cy.visit('https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium')
  .then(() => {
    const errorAnalysis = 'Sir/Ma'am, I've detected an error page, and I'm not thrilled about it...';
    return cy.wrap(errorAnalysis);
  });
```
#### Fix 3: Use `cy.get()` to Get the Error Message

If the code needs to get the error message, use `cy.get()` to get the element containing the error message. This will allow the code to get the error message asynchronously.

Example:
```javascript
cy.visit('https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium')
  .then(() => {
    cy.get('div.error-message').then((errorMessage) => {
      const errorAnalysis = 'Sir/Ma'am, I've detected an error page, and I'm not thrilled about it...';
      // Code to analyze error page visually
    });
  });
```
By implementing one or more of these fixes, the test should pass and the code should be able to analyze the error page visually correctly.
