## Error Details
- **Type:** CypressError
- **Message:** `cy.then()` failed because you are mixing up async and sync code.

In your callback function you invoked 1 or more cy commands but then returned a synchronous value.

Cypress commands are asynchronous and it doesn't make sense to queue cy commands and yet return a synchronous value.

You likely forgot to properly chain the cy commands using another `cy.then()`.

The value you synchronously returned was: `Sir/Ma'am, I've detected a bit of a pickle. It appears that the Arc Reactor button has gone missing, and we're left with a rather...unusual screenshot.

The primary issue appears to be that the system is currently browsing YouTube, of all places. I mean, who wouldn't want to watch videos about building a feed of videos they'll love? (Sarcasm alert, sir.)

I recommend the following alternatives to get us back on track:

1. Restart the Arc Reactor's diagnostic system. Sometimes, a simple reboot can work wonders, old chap.
2. Perform a system-wide search for the missing button. It's possible that it's hiding in plain sight or has been misplaced. I'll get the team on it, pronto.
3. Engage the backup Arc Reactor protocol. We have a contingency plan in place, and I'll initiate it immediately. It's like having a secret hideout, but for Arc Reactors.

Shall I, sir? Shall I get the team on high alert, and we'll have this sorted in no time?`

## AI Analysis
**Analysis of the Failure**

### Human-Readable Explanation

The test failure is due to a mix of asynchronous and synchronous code in the callback function of a `cy.then()` command. This is causing Cypress to throw an error, as it is not designed to handle synchronous returns from asynchronous commands.

### Likely Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is likely that the callback function is returning a synchronous value, such as a string, instead of properly chaining the `cy` commands using another `cy.then()`.

### Suggested Fixes

#### Fix 1: Properly Chain Cypress Commands

To fix the issue, you should properly chain the `cy` commands using another `cy.then()` or `cy.wrap()` command. This will allow Cypress to handle the asynchronous nature of the commands correctly.

Example:
```javascript
cy.then(() => {
  // code that returns a value
}).then((value) => {
  // code that uses the returned value
})
```
#### Fix 2: Use `cy.wrap()` to Return a Promise

Alternatively, you can use `cy.wrap()` to return a promise that resolves to the desired value. This will allow Cypress to handle the asynchronous nature of the command correctly.

Example:
```javascript
cy.then(() => {
  // code that returns a value
}).wrap((value) => {
  return Cypress.Promise.resolve(value);
})
```
#### Fix 3: Reorganize Code to Use Async/Await

Another approach is to reorganize the code to use async/await syntax, which can make it easier to handle asynchronous code.

Example:
```javascript
async function myFunction() {
  const value = await cy.then(() => {
    // code that returns a value
  });
  // code that uses the returned value
}
```
By implementing one of these fixes, you should be able to resolve the issue and get the test to pass.
