**Test:** ðŸ¤– JARVIS - Tony Stark Mode AI Debugger JARVIS: Visual debugging of failed element search
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/__cypress/iframes/cypress%5Ce2e%5CGroq%5Cjarvis_showcase.cy.js?browserFamily=chromium

## Error Details
- **Type:** TypeError
- **Message:** cy.get(...).should(...).then(...).catch is not a function

## AI Analysis
# Analysis of Failed Test

## Human-Readable Explanation of What Went Wrong

The test failed due to a `TypeError` when trying to use the `then` and `catch` methods with `cy.get()`. This suggests that the `cy.get()` command is not returning a promise that can be chained with `then` and `catch` methods.

## Likely Root Cause

The likely root cause is that the `cy.get()` command is not returning a promise that can be chained with `then` and `catch` methods. This could be due to several reasons such as:

* The element is not found on the page, and `cy.get()` is returning `undefined` instead of a promise.
* The element is found, but the `should()` command is not returning a promise that can be chained with `then` and `catch` methods.

## Suggested Fixes

### Fix 1: Check Element Existence

Make sure that the element is present on the page before trying to interact with it. You can use the `should` command to check if the element is present:
```cypress
cy.get('selector').should('be.visible')
  .then(() => {
    // code to interact with the element
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // handle error
  });
```
### Fix 2: Use `then` and `catch` with `cy.wrap`

Wrap the result of `cy.get()` with `cy.wrap` to ensure that it returns a promise that can be chained with `then` and `catch` methods:
```cypress
cy.get('selector')
  .wrap()
  .then(() => {
    // code to interact with the element
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // handle error
  });
```
### Fix 3: Check Cypress Version

Make sure that you are using a compatible version of Cypress. The `then` and `catch` methods were introduced in Cypress 4.0. If you are using an earlier version, you may need to upgrade to a compatible version.

By implementing one of these fixes, you should be able to resolve the issue and get your test running again.
